# My Work from the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course (Google & Kaggle)

Welcome to my repository for the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive course. This repository serves as a portfolio of my completed projects, hands-on experiments, and key learnings throughout the program.

The course provides a deep dive into the theory, architecture, and practical implementation of building sophisticated AI agents. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a day in the course, documenting the concepts learned and the agents I built.

## Course Structure & Projects

### ➡️ [Day 1: Introduction to Agents & Multi-Agent Architectures](./Day-1/)

*   **Concepts Covered:** Core agent anatomy (Model, Tools, Orchestration), the "Think, Act, Observe" loop, and the taxonomy of agentic systems.
*   **Key Skills:** Built a single, tool-enabled agent with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). Designed and implemented a complex, multi-agent system that combines Sequential, Parallel, and Loop workflow patterns.
*   **Highlight:** My custom "Final Year Project Roadmap Generator" which demonstrates a full end-to-end multi-agent pipeline.

### ➡️ Day 2: (Coming Soon)

**Course Attribution:** This work is based on the official course materials provided by Google and Kaggle. My goal in this repository is to document my personal application of the concepts and my unique experiments that go beyond the base curriculum.
